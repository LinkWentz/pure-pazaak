# Pure Pazaak
Pazaak was a minigame in a 2003 Star Wars RPG called Knights of the Old Republic. It's essentially dueling blackjack, with an added resource management element in cards that allow you to modify your hand for a round. For some reason this minigame in a short lived series of RPGs from before iPhones were invented was somehow never adapted into its own standalone version. So I decided to fix that gross oversight, and add multiplayer to really put BioWare's game-within-a-game design to the test.
