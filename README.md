# Pure Pazaak
Pure Pazaak is a web app made so that you can play the galaxy's premier competitive blackjack game in a browser with your friends! First created for the 2003 RPG Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Pazaak is a game in which two players try to get as close to 20 as possible without going over. To that end, each player is given a side deck of four modifier cards which can adjust a player's score and potentially turn a bust into a victory if played.

While the original minigame was fun, being in an exclusively single player RPG means that you could never see what it was like to play against another person. So, like a much more basic version of what happened to Gwent, I decided to make this to find out. To be honest, I've mostly just played Pazaak with myself while testing it, so I'm not sure how much of the original question I actually answered, but I certainly learned a lot of other things while making it.

### How it works:
The app itself manages games based off of a room system. Once you open the app you can put in a 4 character alphanumeric room code and hit join and you will be placed in a room and given a link to send to a friend. Or to put in a new tab if you too would like to play Pazaak with yourself. Your friend can also join the same way you did if you would prefer.
