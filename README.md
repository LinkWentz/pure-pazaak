# Pure Pazaak
Pazaak was a minigame in a 2003 Star Wars RPG called Knights of the Old Republic. It's essentially dueling blackjack, with an added resource management element in cards that allow you to modify your hand for a round. It's honestly pretty fun, and surprisingly no one has made a multiplayer version of it so I figured I'd give it a shot.

And if I may say so, I think I did pretty well. While there are some features like deck building and special cards that are missing from my version - features that I plan to add once I have the time - the game works and it works well. But don't take my word for it, play it yourself!
